As the demand for Workday Application grows, so does the complexity and breadth of Integrations to get data in and out of Workday. It can become really expensive for all the integrations you want if your organization picks an implementation partner. It is here we can help you cut down the cost and bring the expertise you need and provide end to end Integration workstream support from Discovery with vendors to Design, Build, Test and Support all your workday integration needs. Typically in any Workday tenant, 60% of the integrations are simple integrations EIB's built with RaaS, custom report transformations, connectors with document transformation, or Workday Studio.

We offer our services at a very competitive cost either a fixed cost project or flex hourly rate no more than $50 to $70/hr depending upon the complexity of the integration. Not sure about how we can help, please check out our case study section...
